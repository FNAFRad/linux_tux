<h1>Linux Tux Explained</h1>
<h3>Tux is a penguin character and the official brand character of the Linux kernel.
    Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, 
    Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, 
    although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles.
    The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux.</h3>
    <h4>The concept of the Linux brand character being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, 
        the creator of Linux. According to Jeff Ayers, Linus Torvalds had a "fixation for flightless,
        fat waterfowl" and Torvalds claims to have contracted "penguinitis"
        after being nibbled by a little penguin on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium in Canberra, Australia</h4>
